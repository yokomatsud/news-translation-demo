Deploying a web application can seem daunting, but with the right tools and guidance, it becomes a manageable task. We are excited to share a comprehensive course on the [freeCodeCamp.org][1] YouTube channel that will explain this process. This course will guide you through deploying web applications using various services, including Azure, Render, MongoDB Atlas, Koyeb, and more.

In this course, Kerollos Magdy, a Microsoft software engineer, takes you step-by-step through different methods to deploy web applications. The course starts with free options and then explain how to deploy using Microsoft Azure. Regardless of the programming language or framework you use, you should be able to deploy using the same steps.

The first part of the course introduces you to deploying applications using free and sometimes open source options. In the second section, you'll get a detailed walkthrough on deploying applications using Microsoft Azure, a powerful cloud service provider. Azure’s comprehensive suite of tools and services makes it a popular choice for developers, and this course will show you how to leverage its full potential.

Coros Magdi brings his expertise and passion for open-source technologies to this course, making complex concepts accessible and understandable. He uses various examples to illustrate the deployment process, demonstrating how to deploy both backend and frontend applications. You'll learn about setting up a PostgreSQL database, deploying backend services, and ensuring your frontend is properly integrated.

The course also covers other services like Render, MongoDB Atlas, and Koyeb, providing you with a broad understanding of different deployment environments. Render is particularly highlighted for its ability to deploy both backend and frontend applications seamlessly. You’ll follow along as Kerollos sets up a Render account, creates a PostgreSQL database, and deploys an application using Node.js and Prisma.

By the end of this course, you'll have the knowledge to choose the most suitable deployment solution for your projects. Whether you're working on a hobby project or a professional application, these skills are invaluable. The course ensures you’re well-equipped to handle deployment tasks confidently and efficiently.
